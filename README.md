### Hey there Web DEVs, This is Aagam! 👋
<hr />

I'm a Junior Year student pursuing Bachelor of Technology in Electronics and Communication 🎓 from Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra 🏛. From the beginning I am very much interested in designing of different websites so I started Web Developing and I am ready to surpass ⏩ all the upcoming challenges and curious to learn any form of language that helps in designing and developing 🔨 a website. I love to explore new technologies and leverage them to solve real-life problems 💥. I'm currently into React and eagerly waiting for new opportunites to showcase myself.
